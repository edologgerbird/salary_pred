Company X is implementing a Data Governance programme as part of our Data Transformation journey. The new Data Governance framework will enable improved Investment Data Quality by reinforcing Data Ownership across the Business and rolling-out systematic Investment Data Quality Controls as per the DQM Framework (ie.

Ensure data sets are complete, and represent exhaustively our Target Operating Model (eg. General Assets vs ILP, different asset class and it’s investment lifecycle)
Ensure Data Quality - besides data completeness, it is imperative to ensure data is also accurate (single source of truth) and timely so it can be used with confidence by business users in their investment processes (This will include identifying key elements underpinning data quality, understanding how data is used and why it is important and bridging the gap in the investment processes)

Hence, as part of the Data Governance programme Company X is implementing a Data Governance tool to systemize and automate the data quality check, ensuring that only appropriate exceptions are raised and allocated to relevant staff for action. This tool will also enable more efficient and effect data error reporting, which in turns enables us to immediately review any data process gaps and fix them timely.

Who We Are
Holistics makes it easy for both data and business teams to model and analyze their company data. We support over 200 fast-growing tech companies, including unicorns, across 30 countries. Our platform processes over 5 million analytics queries every month for over 5000 users globally.
Holistics Datasets help business teams understand and explore the data available for them to build their own reports without over-relying on their data team.
These datasets are built from Holistics Data Models, that simplifies work processes and reduces unnecessary repetitive work for data teams.
About This Role
You will take calls with prospects around the world to assess if Holistics can address their analytics use-cases.
You will be both the product expert, and work with our customers to help them get business value from using Holistics by onboarding them successfully.
This requires a good mix of technical acumen, problem discovery skills, and the ability to frame Holistics in a positive light.
Your Background
We're looking for people who are hungry to learn.
You should be proficient with SQL.

Knowledge of the data space isn't necessary; we are happy to teach you about the ins and outs of the current landscape. (We wrote an acclaimed book about this, so we know what we're talking about!)

That said, it is a plus if you have some experiences in the data world. For instance, you could have worked as:

SQL Data Analyst or Data Engineer where you have experience working on analytics requests from the business
Customer-facing Business Operations, where you have experience using data to inform and automate business processes
B2B Sales Engineer or Customer Success with a strong technical analytics skills
B2B Sales Rep with technical aptitude to sell technical analytics products
Any other background that fulfills the requirements below
Core Responsibilities
Your core responsibilities will be to front interactions with the market, and help to share new market insights internally to help with inform our company's strategic decisions. This includes:
Taking discovery video calls with prospects and customers around the world
Providing software walk-through demos and technical onboarding session
Updating CRM and meeting notes after the calls
Team Responsibilities
You will be part of the growth team who's responsible to help customers evaluate, buy, and remain with Holistics. Besides your core responsibilities, you will also be helping to contribute to several cross-functional functional team areas
Customer Service Duty: We rotate customer service duty across the entire growth team to help
Docs Squad: Help the team contribute to public docs and guides to help answer commonly asked questions at scale.
Pre-Sales: Help your colleagues address questions related to analytics or product use-cases
Insights team: Conduct joint win-review and customer success calls with the marketing insights team
Requirements
Strong SQL skills for data analytics purposes. This is really important to us! We expect you to be able to use our product, and to conduct fairly technical demos with prospective customers. This demands some proficiency with SQL. We are willing to train you if your SQL is rusty (tell us during the interview!), but we do expect you to be willing to pick up SQL, and willing to write complex queries for breakfast.
Enough technical acumen to understand concepts and trends in the data space. We'll educate you on developments in data and the broader 'analytics engineering' landscape, but you should be willing to learn about the entire industry!
Excellent active listening and conversational skills
Strong problem discovery and framing skills
Strong communication and documentation/instructional writing skills
Good-to-have: Experience with Git would be nice! We are working on several features that integrate with Git. If you don't have experience with Git, then we expect that you are willing to learn Git as part of the job. (And, again, we'll teach you).
Remote Work: Ability to work remotely, and keep the team updated on your progress
Ability to plan and set aside scheduled time-slots to cater for calls in US time-zones (this time will be considered as part of your total working hours). We currently operate in Asia but service multiple customers in the US and Europe. This means that team members often have to take calls at night, in order to fit into our customers's schedules. You'll expect to share in such responsibilities.
