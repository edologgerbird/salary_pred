What we do
Niometrics captures, organises and extracts insights from some of the biggest and most complicated datasets that our modern societies currently produce. We put a magnifying glass on the realities collectively constructed by billions of connected individuals and machines, making sense of how humanity is re-creating wholly new digital universes with bits and bytes – universes that need to be seen, interpreted and explained. From taking deep dives into digital behaviours, to exploring the most intimate interactions between network technology and user experiences, we do it all.
Our Data Science team consists of ambitious, creative and passionate individuals, united in the common goal of making a difference. With millions of users generating hundreds of TBs of data daily, our day-to-day job becomes an adventure of connecting digital signals with real-life habits to formulate granular audience insights – who they are, how they behave, and ultimately, how we can expect them to behave in the future. The action does not stop there – we also take pride in working with the latest high-end hardware and world-class software architecture. This means there are virtually no limits to the scope of future events we can model, giving us insights on not just people, but also the entire inter-connected ecosystem to which they belong.
We are perfectionists and we do not hide it. You will join a thrilling environment, implementing and deploying data science solutions that are both efficient and secure, setting the basis for a groundbreaking software platform for the long run.

Your role as Data Scientist
As a Data Scientist, you will work end-to-end, leading entire projects and owning their outcomes through their entire lifecycle. You will formulate hypotheses on structured and unstructured data, design experiments, draw meaningful conclusions and effectively communicate the results to business stakeholders. You will be part of a relentless team, curious to extract the highest value possible in the most effective way. You will put into action your machine learning skills, and together, we will build optimum algorithms for regression, classification, clustering, and information extraction.
